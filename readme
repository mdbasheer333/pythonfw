how allure works:
    every machine should have allure command line zip downloaded and added to system env variable
    download from here allure-commandline-2.8.0.zip
    https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/qameta/allure/allure-commandline/2.8.0/
how to see allure report:
    go to allure folder, open command line and run 'allure serve .'
how to generate allure report:
     go to allure folder, open command line and run 'allure generate'
     once report generated, you can zip and send mail
     but it will not open directly in browser
     we need to unzip, open command line, go to that path
     then run 'allure open'
